TODO rename article to like "ASCII art on the modern web"? Then make "ASCII art in React/Remix" a separate article?

TODO intro about ascii art, my logo, etc

## Making the art

For my logo I used the excellent [REXpaint](https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/index.html) made by [Josh Ge/Grid Sage Games](https://www.gridsagegames.com/). The app and info about its usage are detailed on the REXpaint site.

### Exporting

REXpaint obviously allows for very detailed and sophisticated ASCII art, but I know mine is going to be monochrome, so I'm not going to use any of the color/layer data from the native `.rx` file. Instead I'll simply [export the file as text](https://github.com/Lucide/REXPaint-manual/blob/master/manual.md#appendix-e-exportable-text-formats-txt-csv-xml-bbcode) by pressing `Ctrl-t`. This saves a `.txt` file in the `images` directory local to the REXpaint app.

## Using the art

At this stage, you could simply copy and paste the contents of the file into your project, perhaps like so:

```ts
// TODO
```

I'm using Remix, which uses Vite/Rollup under the hood, so here's how I use the `.txt` file.

### Loading the ASCII data

You might be tempted to try to `import` the `txt` file:

```ts
import asciiArtString from "./ascii-art.txt";
```

This is the right thinking! But if you print out `asciiArtString`, you'll see that it's actually just the URL to the file:

```ts
console.log({ asciiArtString });
// -> "TODO"
```

The key here is to instruct Vite to [import the contents of the file as a string](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-string), which is done by adding the `?raw` suffix to the filepath:

```ts
import asciiArtString from "./ascii-art.txt?raw";
```

## Importing the font

Take note of the font that REXpaint is using for the art file.

In REXpaint it's called "CP437" which happens to also be called "IBM PC BIOS". I thought I could just pull the font file directly out of the REXpaint app directory, but it's using individual `.png` images for each symbol, and I need a single webfont in a format like `.woff`. I found a IBM BIOS webfont in [The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack (v2.2)](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/font?ibm_bios) which I happily [leeched](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/download/) and copied into my project (thanks VileR!).
