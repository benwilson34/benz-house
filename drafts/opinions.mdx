Below you will find my terrible opinion on various technologies and topics.

## Web development

**JavaScript**: the most flexible footgun ❤ `typeof null === 'object'`

**TypeScript**: footgun with static typing 👍 now you can spend time writing type definition files instead of features

**Python**: I don't really like the syntax tbh

**Node.js**: 💖

**React.js**: 💖

**Next.js**: some nice ideas but why is it so hard to configure? Also is Vercel trapping devs?

**Remix.js**: pretty neat so far. I don't get why I can't deeply nest route files tho

**Next Auth aka Auth.js**: why is it so difficult to get the `sub` field of a JWT 🥴

## Native development

**C**: I think I love the manual more than the language itself

**C++**: I've tried to pick it up a few times and it's just too ugly

**Java**: the ugliest most useful language that I'll never write again

**Rust**: haven't finished the tutorial yet 😌

## Web architecture

**Distributed monolith**: underrated pattern. Maybe it's a good thing that your bad app idea doesn't scale?

**Microservices**: more of a guideline than a strict thing to aim for
