I think it would be good for me to do these monthly review articles where I just say in brief what I've been up to. I've been turned off by a lot of social media lately (ok, I've been turned off for years) and I think it's worth trying this format out for people who want to keep in touch with me.

Some recent interests:

- learning to [riffle shuffle](https://youtu.be/NdCia_d1u5c?si=fQmYOh84Rwe6phXW). I actually started learning this just before the new year but I've gotten the technique way more during January.
- making [homemade bagels](https://youtu.be/cF-vuTPdOhQ?si=gM7cpWTmZiO73ppL). We made this recipe for the second and third time this month and they came out pretty good!
- learning the card game [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lady) and [strategies](https://mark.random-article.com/hearts/index.html). I'm surprised with how deep the strategy goes - I still don't have a reliable general approach.
- learning the card game [Gin Rummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy). My girlfriend regularly schools me in our nightly games but I enjoy it either way.
- making a custom font? I did some research and found some tools but haven't done more than that. I think I could make some cool fonts 😎
- still obsessed with UFO 50. I beat Velgress and got cherry on it too.
