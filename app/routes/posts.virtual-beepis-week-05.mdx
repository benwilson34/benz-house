New feature: mini-games! Right now there's only one mini-game, a very minimal jumping game that only adult beepii can play. Jump over an infinite series of broken bottles (more obstacles to come!) and get a coin reward for how well you do.

We also made it so that poops and coins on the screen will stack to fill the screen, up to 4 rows of 4 each. Stack em to the ceiling:

We've got some improvements to the mini-game in the pipeline and a BIG new feature planned for a few weeks from now. Let us know what you think!
