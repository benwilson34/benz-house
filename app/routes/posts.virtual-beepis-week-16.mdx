Lots of small stuff this week! We've got more sound effects, animation and art asset adjustments, screen backgrounds, and two more achievements. Here are all the relevant changes:

- Coin spend animation: as the player buys something in the store, the coins will be pulled back into the unit, like it's vacuuming them up.
- Screen backgrounds: the home and game screens now have fun and flavorful backgrounds.
- New manual assets: new manual cover and achievement icons have been swapped in.
- When the unit does not have power, the screens on the buttons will turn off.
- Added two more achievements. See the Achievements page in the manual for hints!
- Bugfix: splash screen not showing on Desktop builds.

Download the latest and check out these changes!
