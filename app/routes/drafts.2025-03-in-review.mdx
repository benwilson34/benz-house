Some recent interests:

- Still obsessed with UFO 50. I beat and got cherry on Fist Hell and Campanella 3.
- Started building a platform/riser for my drums in my basement from some reclaimed pallets. Next step will be building frames around it for my acoustic panels, similar to what I did at my last house.
