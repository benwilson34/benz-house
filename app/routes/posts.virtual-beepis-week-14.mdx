This week we made some adjustments to the look of the beepis unit and the way the coins behave. They're small changes but together, they feel a lot more complete. We're approaching release — more on that in the coming weeks!

Here are the changes:

- Updated unit model (including a little hatch that opens up when the items are spawning!)
- Better table item behavior — now there's gravity and tweaked physics to make the table items feel more real. And you can click on the coins to spin them, which is really addicting.
- No more GUI coin counter — the coins just pile up on the table and you spend them from there. We thought this would be more fun and intuitive. Plus did I mention that spinning the coins around is addicting?
- Bugfix: if the beepis dies while the player is on a different screen (stats or store), then the screen will change to show it as it dies. You can't run away from your fate.
- Bugfix: coin count is now properly reset when clearing save data.
