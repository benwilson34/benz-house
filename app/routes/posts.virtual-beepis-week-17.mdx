We're starting to wrap this project up! Looking at our schedule, it's looking like we're going to release the game at the end of June or the beginning of July - look out for more updates on that in the coming weeks üôè

The biggest change this week was adding a credits page to the manual. Nothing crazy, but it felt good to finally properly attribute the assets and tools we used.

Otherwise, there are some tweaks to the on-unit nav icons, the jumping minigame, and the general sound effects.

Download the latest to try them out!
