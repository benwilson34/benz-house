**virtual beepisâ„¢ has officially released!!**

We're so proud of how this project has developed over the past year. It's been a ton of fun and a huge learning experience for all of us. And now it's time to call it officially released!

That being said, we still have a handful of nice-to-have features and improvements that we plan on filtering through in the coming months. So expect some post-release updates as well ðŸ˜ŠðŸš¬

I'm writing this in the middle of the night so I don't have a ton more to say but thank you so so so much to all the people who downloaded the betas and gave us their thoughts. And all the people who tolerated me talking about beepis for a year (mainly my partner and roommates).

Check out 1.0 and have fun with your beepis! â™¥
