## Launchy

Press `Alt+Space` or another global shortcut to open a prompt where you can type the name of an app to launch it. In theory you could just as well press `Win` once to open the Start Menu then type the name of the app, but I don't like that Bing web search results get mixed in. Years ago I found this app and it enabled me to delete all the icons from my desktop, and I've never gone back.

## XMeters

This adds resource meters to your Taskbar: a bank of meters for CPU usage, and one more for RAM usage. There are also meters for network activity and storage, but I don't use those. This is partly for vanity and partly so I can keep an eye on my system resources.

## PowerToys

A suite of utilities that come endlessly in handy. My favorites are Fancy Zones and the color picker.

## 7+ Taskbar Tweaker

This great little utility does exactly as it's named: it lets you tweak the Taskbar! There are way more options than I need, but here are the ones I use:

- Under "Grouping": Don't group
- Hide the Start Button
- Hide the "Show desktop" button
- Display seconds on the tray clock

## Greenshot

Screenshot utility

## XYplorer

Best Windows file explorer by a mile.

## ConEmu

Terminal emulator.

## Bonus: Quick Link menu and more built-ins

You don't have to install this one, it's already built into Windows! Press `Win+X` to open the Quick Link menu which gives you a bunch of useful shortcuts, like opening the Settings (`Win+X, Y`) or putting your computer to sleep (`Win+X, U, S`).

Windows actually has a bunch of shortcuts built in that I don't see much mention of! Press `Shift+Win+/` to open the hint overlay which lists them all out.
