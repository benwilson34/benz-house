We're so excited for this week's changes!! It all started with some huuuuuge improvements to the lighting & color in the game following [Alex Strook's excellent Unity lighting tutorial](https://youtu.be/f6zUot73-gg). There are still some tweaks to be made, but it already looks so much brighter and more visually consistent:

The drop shadows on the table don't hurt either ðŸ˜‰

Motivated by the fresh coat of paint, we're also introducing a new feature: batteries! Like any other piece of electronic gear, the beepis unit needs power. Luckily there are two beepisâ„¢ brand batteries right there for you to drag 'n drop into place. Feeling even more tactile with this feature! (You can also take the batteries out after putting them in, I don't know why you would but you can do it.)
