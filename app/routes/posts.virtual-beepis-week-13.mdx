This week we've added a brand new minigame! A beepis nymph can play this very simple catching-type game (is there a name for this type of game mechanic?) to earn coins.

Like the jumping minigame, we have plans to make the game more challenging the longer the player stays in it.

Check out the vid below for a preview, download the new build to give it a shot yourself!
