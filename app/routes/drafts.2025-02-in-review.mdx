I turned 30 this month. I was definitely having some kind of existential crisis leading up to it but the day itself was really good.

Some recent interests:

- I started playing Need for Speed Underground Rivals for the PSP again and had the idea to make an HD texture pack. I spent a bunch of nights picking through the files on the disc image trying to figure out the texture formats, learning about EA's proprietary file formats and disassembly. I put it down because I lack the skills to really progress, but maybe I'll go back to it some day 🤔
- Was craving some other throwback racing games so I played some Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Revenge on the PS2 too 😎
- I started drafting takes for a video tentatively titled "how to find new music" with just all the methods and techniques I know and use for finding new music. Work in progress, will update.
- Started preparing my recent job search data for some data visualizations just for fun. I keep a detailed record of my applications and activity on them, so it wasn't much work to export it and start analyzing. At first I was going to use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) but the official examples reference another of their packages, [Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/), which has a way simpler API, so I think I'm going to go with that.
- Jumped back on UFO 50 and I'm still obsessed. I beat Avianos, Elfazar's Hat, and got cherry on Elfazar's Hat and Kick Club.
