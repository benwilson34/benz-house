Hey all, we have a big announcement this week: **virtual beepis will officially release Thursday July 1, 2021!** 🙏😊🚬

We also started getting our Steam Store page together, so look out for an update on that later in the week!

The build this week has even more sound effects, and some cool background music for the minigames. Check out the latest!
