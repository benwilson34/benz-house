I realized I missed making this list last year, probably because I hardly use Instagram anymore (which is where I used to post these lists). Oops! Well I can't break my streak of 15+ years, so here's my retroactive 2023 top ten.

I've listened to a bunch of 2023 albums during 2024 but considering those doesn't seem consistent with previous years, so I'm only considering the albums I listened to up to Dec 31, 2023. You don't care about those details anyway, so here's the list, starting with my most favorite!

1. feeble little horse - Girl with Fish ⭐ fave track: "Steamroller"
1. death's dynamic shroud - Transcendence Bot ⭐ fave track: "Over Again"
1. George Clanton - Ooh Rap I Ya ⭐ fave track: "Punching Down"
1. Westerman - An Inbuilt Fault ⭐ fave track: "I, Catallus."
1. The Armed - Perfect Saviors ⭐ fave track: "Burned Mind"
1. Caroline Polachek - Desire, I Want To Turn Into You ⭐ fave track: "Billions"
1. ROLROLROL - Music ⭐ fave track: "WHEELER DEALER"
1. 100 gecs - 10,000 Gecs ⭐ fave track: "Doritos & Fritos"
