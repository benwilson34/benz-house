The new feature we teased last week is ready - a manual! This little paper booklet contains some achievements for you to try to unlock. We also moved the settings there to clean up the interface. There are more achievements planned, as well as some actual instructions (but we're not going to tell you how to do everything!).

Figuring out how the pages should move so they aren't overlapping & z-fighting was a bit of a challenge, but it was a lot of fun coming up with this solution. I also always love tightening up the interface. Check out how the screen looks when the manual is hidden - so simple! You can click on the faux sticky note buttons on the right to open the manual up to that page.

Check it out in action, and give it a try!
