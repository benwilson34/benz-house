We're very excited to announce that we're bringing on an audio producer to do the sound effects for beepis! We've got the first of his SFX in this week's build and some minor improvements to the jumping minigame: there's now a trash bag obstacle to jump over, and the game will speed up as your score increases.

The project is kind of in its last beta phase leading up to release. We're still working out the release schedule (or maybe the schedule is working us out...) but it's looking like sometime in June - not too far off! But the major features are all there. Now we're working more on the polishing the visuals, balancing the game systems, and ironing out the whole gameplay experience overall.

No preview vid this week, check out the latest build for the updates!
