This week we're releasing something we've been working on for a while: evolution lines! Now there is a whole second line of beepii to raise and enjoy. Right now the line is chosen randomly as the egg hatches, but we might change that to give the player some way to choose between them. Here are the new larva and nymph:

There's a new adult too, but you'll have to raise your beepis and see it for yourself ðŸ˜‰ we have more evo lines planned so your experience varies from beepis to beepis as they die and are gloriously reborn ðŸ˜Š

We also added a simple splash screen over the weekend â€“ a small addition but it makes the game feel more polished for sure!
