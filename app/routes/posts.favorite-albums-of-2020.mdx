My favorite 2020 albums yall. Or at least the ones I downloaded. For once I tried to put them in (descending) order, roast me in the comments or tell me what my idiot ass missed/forgot üëáüëá

1. **Poppy - I Disagree**. Nu metal is back with a vengeance I guess. Theatrical, detailed, fascinating. ‚≠ê "I Disagree"
2. **Machine Girl - U-Void Synthesizer**. Louder and grosser than ever. Noisecore? ‚≠ê "Suck Shit"
3. **Machinedrum & Holly - Berry Patch** (ep). Delicious imaginative bass music. ‚≠ê "Yangmei"
4. **Angelica Garcia - Cha Cha Palace**. A late pick but super addictive indie pop(?) ‚≠ê "Lucifer Waiting"
5. **Rina Sawayama - Sawayama**. 2020 was the year of nu metal pop?? ‚≠ê "STFU!"
6. **(K)NoW_NAME - DOROHEDORO ENDING THEME ALBUM: DANCE in the CHAOS**. Widely influenced, fun + tasteful listen. ‚≠ê "Who am I ?"
7. **Meridian Brothers - Cumbia Siglo XXI**. Colombian experimental...synth rock? Super playful and weird. ‚≠ê "Cumbia Del Relicario"
8. **Machinedrum - A View of U**. What more can I say about TS? More masterful electronic work, great collabs. ‚≠ê "Sleepy Pietro"
9. **Sully - Swandive** (ep). Nutty creative breaks/DnB. Controlled, considering how busy it is. ‚≠ê "Swandive"
10. **dgoHn - Undesignated Proximate**. Atmospheric breaks, very listenable and intentional. ‚≠ê "Turnips Are OK"
